    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook uses the [lein-jupyter plugin](https://github.com/didiercrunch/lein-jupyter) to be able to execute Clojure code in\n",
    "project setting. The first time that you run it you will need to install the kernal with `lein jupyter install-kernel`.\n",
    "After that you can open the notebook in the project directory with `lein jupyter notebook`\n",
    "\n",
    "The Deep Learning library in Clojure that we are using is called [Cortex](https://github.com/thinktopic/cortex)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this is to take the dataset from the [Kaggle Cats and Dogs Redux Competiton](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition)\n",
    "and train a model. We will then run the model on the Kaggle testing data and submit the results to see how we compare."

    "You should now have a directory structure that looks like `data/train` with inside the directory lots of pictures like `cat.156.jpg` and `dog.1.jpg`\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing that we need to do is to run the `.get-resnet50.sh` in the root of the project. What this is going to do is download a pretrained model that is meant to classify 1000 images types from the [ImageNet competition](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/). This model and its weights have been translated into a Cortex network format `nippy` "
